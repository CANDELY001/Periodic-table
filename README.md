## Using the Periodic Table Interface

### Overview

The Periodic Table Interface provides users with a visual representation of the periodic table of elements and a menu to display elements based on their type. The interface is divided into several sections:

- Periodic Table: This section displays the periodic table of elements, allowing users to view information about each element.

- Element Menu: This section provides a menu that allows users to display elements based on their type, such as metals, nonmetals, and metalloids.

### Customizing the Interface

The Periodic Table can be customized using CSS. To make changes to the appearance of the interface, edit the `index.css` file.

## Acknowledgments

This interface was inspired by the classic periodic table of elements and various periodic table interfaces available online.
